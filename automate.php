                        As thousands poured into the iconic McCormick place for the Automate Conference, the air 
                        in the conference hall was abuzz. Industry 4.0 is here, and it's ready to not only move the
                        needle but completely change the way we will see the future today. I anticipate the next couple 
                        of years to be the ushering in of a newer and more disruptive Industrial revolution. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="primary_text">
                    Having been to this conference hall dozens of times, attending everything from Microsoft Ignite to 
                    various other local conferences and shows, there was something uniquely distinct about this time. 
                    Conferences tend to be the breeding grounds to showcase innovative ideas, new product lines and ultimately 
                    create a certain degree of dialogue about a newer concept. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="primary_text">
                        The initial makeup of the conference was very distinct: It was purely talking about Robotics and Industrial 
                        Automation. Having been in the RPA world as an expert and consultant, also known as "Robotic Process Automation,
                        " we always contended with the moniker "Robotic" as it was seen as being associated with actual Physical robots, 
                        rather than software automation meant to emulate human behavior on-screen. This conference was the first moment 
                        both of those concepts collided together. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="primary_text">
                        Something to point out however: No one knew this was happening, so it felt like an out of body experience to see 
                        both sides of the "Robotics" collide. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="primary_text">
                        The conversations in the conference hall were equally disruptive and innovative. If you had to summarize the two sides of the conference it would be Industrial manufacturers and companies looking to automate the front-end user-interface of Industrial manufacturers. As an RPA expert, this is an explosive opportunity as we think about democratizing how your average hardware worker or business can operate or access very complicated systems and products. We are used to the swivel chair situations, the declining availability of workers that have the skill sets to operate these complicated systems and ultimately the GenAI boom is fueling the need to go no-code & develop a model where human language prevails...over code. 
                    </p>
              
                    <p class="primary_text">
                    Additionally, Industrial manufacturing is relying more and more on AI. Think of the leading construction cranes or logistics companies...the cost of operating and maintaining these types of devices is astronomical and the need to developer smarter systems that provide direct and instantaneous feedback on their performance is not a "nice to have" but a "must have" in today's market. If a John Deere trailer goes down in Rural Illinois, the time between reporting it and repairing it is a big opportunity cost, AI can not only accelerate the ability to report what is wrong but to connect with the required repairman to properly service it...laying out this process is critical. 
                    </p>
          
                    <p class="primary_text">
                    There are thousands of different use cases that fit a similar profile: Intelligent Automation, whether the RPA or AI revolution are uniquely positioned to accelerate the laying out and decision logic to blueprint processes required to lay out how to solve these problems. 

                    </p>
             
                    <p class="primary_text">
                    Industrial manufacturing is in dire need of this type of technology; and thousands of vendors are developing drag and drop interfaces to help with this challenge. 

                    </p>
                    <p class="primary_text">
                        Why not combine the capabilities of both of these well-established industries together? Fireworks can happen.
