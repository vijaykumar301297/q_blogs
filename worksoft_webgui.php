                        Many established businesses face a crossroads when considering an SAP S/4HANA migration.
                        While the promise of a modern, digital core is enticing, the challenge of migrating their 
                        existing customizations can be daunting. This blog post dives into brownfield deployment strategies 
                        and how Worksoft's innovative solution helps bridge the gap between legacy systems and the future of SAP.

                        Brownfield Deployment: Minimizing Disruption, Maximizing Efficiency
                    </h2>
                    <p class="secondary_text">
                        Brownfield deployment is a migration strategy that prioritizes minimal re-engineering of existing systems. 
                        This approach offers faster time-to-value by leveraging proven functionalities and workflows. However, testing 
                        these migrated systems remains a significant hurdle.

                            <strong>SAP GUI:</strong> This traditional interface remains compatible with S/4HANA. <strong>Importantly, in many cases, your existing SAP GUI automation 
                            for ECC can be executed against the S/4HANA system on SAP GUI without any changes as long as the underlying SAP workflow has not 
                            changed.</strong> This is a significant benefit for businesses that want to minimize upfront migration effort. However, some deprecated 
                            transactions and workflow changes might require you to adapt existing automation scripts.
